Cowbell
=======

Cowbell is an Android application I am developing to learn parts of the
Android SDK. Basically, the application loads an image of a cowbell on the
screen, and when you shake your phone, the cowbell rotates and makes a cowbell
sound.

The only non-standard directory in this repository is the
`nonpackaged_resources` directory which is where original media resources are
stored that are not intended to be included in the APK that would be shipped.
